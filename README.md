# WiFi-Indoor-Localization-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements a WiFi-based indoor localization system using RSSI fingerprinting and classical machine learning. Using the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, it predicts building, floor, and spatial coordinates via classification and regression models. KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost are evaluated with PCA to handle high-dimensional RSSI data.
